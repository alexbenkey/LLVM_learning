# Complete LLVM IR Learning Path

## Overview: Two Complementary Approaches

You now have **12 challenging exercises** that teach LLVM IR from two different angles:

### üîß **Bottom-Up: LLVM IR Track** (6 exercises)
**Learn by implementing**: Write LLVM IR directly to solve problems
- Start with low-level instructions
- Build up to complex algorithms
- Understand the instruction set deeply

### üîÆ **Top-Down: C++ Analysis Track** (6 exercises)
**Learn by analyzing**: Predict how C++ becomes LLVM IR
- Start with high-level C++ features
- Understand compiler transformations
- Bridge the abstraction gap

## Recommended Learning Paths

### Path 1: For LLVM IR Beginners

   - Learn basic syntax and concepts
   - Master control flow and functions

2. **C++ 1-2** (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ to ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ)  
   - See how templates and virtual functions work
   - Connect high-level concepts to IR

3. **LLVM IR 4-6** (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ to ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
   - Tackle advanced algorithms and data structures

4. **C++ 3-5** (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
   - Master advanced C++ implementation details

### Path 2: For C++ Experts
**Start by analyzing familiar C++ code, then implement in pure IR**

1. **C++ 1-2** (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ to ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ)
   - Leverage your C++ knowledge
   - Understand compiler internals

2. **LLVM IR 1-2** (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ to ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ)
   - Learn the instruction set basics

3. **Alternate between tracks**
   - C++ exercise ‚Üí related LLVM IR exercise
   - Build connections between levels

### Path 3: For Compiler Engineers
**Tackle both tracks in parallel for maximum understanding**

1. **Week 1**: LLVM IR 1 + C++ 1 (foundations)
2. **Week 2**: LLVM IR 2 + C++ 2 (analysis skills)  
3. **Week 3**: LLVM IR 3 + C++ 3 (control flow + exceptions)
4. **Week 4**: LLVM IR 4 + C++ 4 (algorithms + closures)
5. **Week 5**: LLVM IR 5-6 + C++ 5 (advanced mastery)
