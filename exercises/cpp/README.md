# C++ Challenge Exercises

## Philosophy: Understanding High-Level to Low-Level Translation

These C++ exercises teach you how modern C++ features are implemented in LLVM IR. This is crucial for understanding:
- **Compiler internals**: How high-level constructs become low-level code
- **Performance implications**: Why certain C++ features have overhead
- **Optimization behavior**: How compilers optimize away abstractions

## Why C++ + LLVM IR?

**Real compiler development** requires understanding both:
1. **High-level semantics**: What the C++ code means
2. **Low-level implementation**: How it's actually executed

These exercises bridge that gap by making you **predict** the LLVM IR that will be generated.

## Challenge Structure

Each exercise follows this pattern:
1. **Complex C++ code** using advanced features
2. **Multiple compilation modes** (-O0 vs -O2)
3. **Output prediction** (what gets printed)
4. **IR analysis** (what LLVM IR gets generated)
5. **Optimization comparison** (how -O2 changes things)

## Learning Approach

### 1. **Analyze the C++ Code**
- Understand what the code does at a high level
- Identify which C++ features are being used
- Predict the runtime behavior

### 2. **Research the Feature**
- Look up how the C++ feature is typically implemented
- Find documentation about LLVM IR representations
- Study similar examples in your `tests/cpp/` directory

### 3. **Make Predictions**
- What will the program output?
- What LLVM IR constructs will be generated?
- How will optimization change the implementation?

### 4. **Test and Learn**
- Run the exercise: `lit exercises/cpp/01_template_detective.cpp`
- Compare your predictions with actual results
- Analyze where you were right/wrong

### 5. **Deep Dive Analysis**
- Study the generated LLVM IR files
- Compare -O0 vs -O2 optimization differences
- Understand why certain optimizations occurred

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test a specific C++ exercise
